# petya_eternal
Application for testing crypto of EternalPetya (aka NoPetya) for eventual bugs
-
<b>WARNING!</b> This is just an experiment! This tool is NOT for cracking key.<br/>
It is just a reimplementation of the Salsa20 version used in EternalPetya.<br/>
The code is shared for the purpose of discussion with other analysts, nothing more!<br/>

<b>If you want to repeat my experiment:</b><br/>
1) Supply the disk dump done BEFORE the Salsa20 key was erased:<br/>
<pre>
./petya_eternal [disk dump]
</pre>
2) See the generated buffer
3) Boot the disk to let the malware encrypt the verification buffer
4) Compare the verification buffer generated by this tool with the one generated by the malware
5) If they are the same, it is a confirmation that EternalPetya uses this BUGGY version of Salsa20
6) Even if we confirm this, it is too early to make a conclusion that we can crack it! But it is a step in a good direction.
